Background
This is a fork of my WaterBot project: the HorseBot! 
It all started when I told my neighbor Ed about my WaterBot project, he told me a sad problem that horses have in the winter. It turns out that most horses don’t drink enough water and get dry feces and need to get surgery to get it removed. A striking 80% die in surgery! So I decided to fork my WaterBot into the HorseBot. 
What it does is it measures the amount of water the horse drinks with an e-tape and gives the results to an app on the owners phone. It will also track the amount and send an alert if it is too low. Another feature is a heater that heats up the water, horses don’t like to drink cold water in the winter. Like the WaterBot, it all runs on a Raspberry Pi. :)
I hope that in the end it can save horses lives.
